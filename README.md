## Strenght
Strenght (iLvl) is set for every wearable item when dropped by a monster.
Default iLvl is calculated using special algorithm that determines monster level/power based on its Max HP and Experience.
Then additional iLvl value is given based on base item stats (Atk, Def, Armor, Hit Chance). After all of that, additional stats are calculated based on item iLvl.
Upgrading item level increases iLvl in addition to bonus stats and values for bonus attributes are based on iLvl of the item.
Given all of that I have made every item different. If you drop a Giant Sword from a Behemoth and a Giant Sword from a Ferumbras they will be different in stats.
You may ask "What if someone loots Sword from high level monster and a new player gets it? That's unbalanced." but don't be afraid.
If player level is lower than iLvl of given items, they **can't** equip them!
